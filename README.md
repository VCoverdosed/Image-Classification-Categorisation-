# Image-Classification-Categorisation-
The   system   based   on   a   Bag-of-Words   feature   model   and   a   non-linear   SVM classifier

In the evolving field of computer vision, automating image classification remains pivotal across
diverse industries. This report explores an advanced approach by integrating the Bag-of-Words (BoW)
model with Support Vector Machines (SVM) for effective image classification.

Originally from natural language processing, the BoW model adapts to visual content by quantising
image features into a structured vocabulary. This transformation facilitates the use of SVM, known
for its proficiency with high-dimensional data and complex nonlinear decision boundaries.

Our methodology consists of key steps: feature extraction, clustering to build the vocabulary,
creating histogram representations of images, and classification via SVM. The report showcases the
training process and the approximate accuracy when tested on the given dataset when split by 9:1
ratio. Evaluations on some parameter adjustments will be covered
